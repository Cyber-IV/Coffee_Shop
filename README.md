# Coffee_Shop

Coffee_Shop is a practice project that simulates a coffee shop website, focused on selling coffee and desserts, as well as sharing relevant information about coffee.

## Current Features

- **Main page** with information about coffee and products.
- **Contact form** with basic validation in JavaScript:
  - Checks that all fields are completed before submitting.
  - Shows error or success notifications to the user.
  - Prevents the default form submission to avoid unnecessary page reloads.
- **Interactivity** in forms using `input` events and DOM manipulation.
- **Modular structure** with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features Not Yet Implemented

- Advanced email validation (correct format).
- Actual data submission to a server (currently only shows local notifications).
- Automatic form clearing after successful submission.
- Improved accessibility (use of `label` tags, accessible messages, etc).
- Prevention of multiple submissions (disable button while processing).
- Network error handling if real submission is implemented.
- Unit tests for JavaScript functions.
